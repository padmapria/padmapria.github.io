# Image-based vehicle traffic monitoring web tutorial

This repository is the web-tutorial of a module where we monitor traffic conditions in Singapore by using  images through a public [API](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/traffic-images), and implements a Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN). A pre-trained Mask-RCMM model. It is divided in three chapters, starting by obtaining the images with python, then the implementation of the pre-trained model. Ending with visualizations of the data.
